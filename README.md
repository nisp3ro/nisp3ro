<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm nisp3roüçä </h1>

## I'm currently learning to program in [42 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/).

My Pool was on June 2024 and I started the Cursus on September 2024 and,                
in these last few months, I'm discovering a world that I'm passionate about.

I will be adding the repositories of all my projects to keep track of my progress.      
If my code is helpful to you or, on the contrary, you would like to advise me on                      
how to improve it, do not hesitate to contact me. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
