I'm currently learning programming at [42 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/).  
I began my journey in June 2024 with my "Piscine" and officially started the Cursus in September 2024.  
In these last few months, I've been exploring a world I'm truly passionate about â€” writing clean, efficient code and building exciting projects.

I document my progress by sharing my projects on GitHub.  
If you find my code helpful or have any advice for improvement, feel free to reach out.
